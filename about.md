"Hello! I'm fascinated by concepts in Computer Vision, 3D Machine Learning, and Geometric Deep Learning, particularly in the context of shape processing for Machine Learning applications. 

Additionally, I've recently been exploring Computer Architecture and RISC-V, which has been a fun and challenging experience. Prior to this, I worked at Tribes AI, an Australian startup which specialized in data analytics and revenue attribution. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Project Management Technology and enjoy reading in my free time.
