"Hi there! I have a personal and professional interest in Computer Vision, 3D Machine Learning, and Geometric Deep Learning (particularly in the context of shape processing for Machine Learning applications). 

Additionally, I recently discovered RISC-V, and it has been a fun experience. Prior to this, I worked at Tribes AI, an Australian startup which specialized in data analytics and revenue attribution. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Project Management Technology and enjoy reading in my free time.
